  "description": "Ozone is an odorless, colorless gas made up of three oxygen molecules (O3) and is a natural part of the environment. It occurs both in the Earthâ€™s upper atmosphere, or stratosphere, and at ground level in the lower atmosphere, or troposphere.",
  "healtheffect": "Breathing ground-level ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion.  It can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ozone also can reduce lung function and inflame the lining of the lungs. Repeated exposure may permanently scar lung tissue.Healthy people also experience difficulty breathing when exposed to ozone pollution. Because ozone forms in hot weather, anyone who spends time outdoors in the summer may be affected, particularly children, outdoor workers and people exercising. Some people who   don't fall into any of these categories may also find themselves sensitive to ozone.",
  "enviromentaleffect": "Ozone damages vegetation and ecosystems by inhibiting the ability of plants to open the microscopic pores on their leaves to breathe. It interferes with the photosynthesis process by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide the plants can process and release as oxygen.Elevated levels of ozone leads to reduced agricultural crop and commercial forest yields, reduced growth and survivability of tree seedlings, and increased susceptibility to diseases, pests and other stresses such as harsh weather."
