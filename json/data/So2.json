  "description": "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a gaseous air pollutant composed of sulfur and oxygen. SO2 forms when sulfur-containing fuel such as coal, petroleum oil, or diesel is burned. Sulfur dioxide gas can also change chemically into sulfate particles in the atmosphere, a major part of fine particle pollution, which can blow hundreds of miles away",
  "healtheffect": "Sulfur dioxide causes a range of harmful effects on the lungs:Wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness and other problems, especially during exercise or physical activity. Rapid breathing during exercise helps SO2 reach the lower respiratory tract, as does breathing through the mouth.Long-term exposure at high levels increases respiratory symptoms and reduces the ability of the lungs to function.Short exposures to peak levels of SO2 in the air can make it difficult for people with asthma to breathe when they are active outdoors.Increased risk of hospital admissions or emergency room visits, especially among children, older adults and people with asthma.",
  "enviromentaleffect": "When sulfur dioxide combines with water and air, it forms sulfuric acid, which is the main component of acid rain. Acid rain can:cause deforestationacidify waterways to the detriment of aquatic lifecorrode building materials and paints.In Queensland, there is less heavy industry than in Europe or North America, where the potential for forming acid rain from sulfur dioxide emissions is higher. Our weather conditions and low sulfur content of fuels reduce the potential for acid rain."
